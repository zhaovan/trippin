## Overview

## Tech Stack

The app currently has the following functionality:

  * View upcoming trips that you've created
  * View previous trips that have already passed
  * Change usernmame/password/update in the database
  * Plan a trip by searching up a location, store relevant reservation information, find nearby locations, and then save it to the database
